Video conferencing has become essential for remote work and virtual collaboration. However, US-based services like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams may expose your meeting data and communications to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives provide secure video conferencing while ensuring your data remains under EU jurisdiction and GDPR protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Video Conferencing Services

1. **Data Residency** - Ensure your meeting data is stored exclusively in EU data centers
2. **End-to-End Encryption** - Check if the service offers true end-to-end encryption
3. **Browser-Based Access** - Some solutions work in browsers without requiring app installs
4. **Meeting Capacity** - Consider maximum participants and meeting duration limits
5. **Collaboration Features** - Screen sharing, chat, recording, and other collaboration tools
6. **Mobile Support** - Compatibility with iOS and Android devices

Browse the alternatives below to find a video conferencing service that meets your privacy and collaboration needs.
