Music streaming, audiobooks, and e-books have transformed how we consume media, but US-based services like Spotify (using US cloud infrastructure), Apple Music, Audible, and Kindle track your media consumption in detail and are subject to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives offer media streaming with better privacy practices and data storage within EU jurisdiction under GDPR protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Media Streaming Services

1. **Content Library** - Consider if the platform has the content you want
2. **Data Collection** - Check what listening/reading data the service tracks
3. **Offline Usage** - Consider if the service allows downloading for offline use
4. **Family Sharing** - Some services offer family plans for better value
5. **Artist Support** - Some European alternatives focus on fair compensation for creators
6. **Format Compatibility** - For e-books, check device and format compatibility

Browse the alternatives below to find media streaming services that respect your privacy while providing music, audiobooks, and e-books.
