Online shopping has become a convenient way to purchase goods, but US-based platforms like Amazon and eBay collect extensive data about your shopping habits, preferences, and personal information, while being subject to US surveillance laws.

2. **Payment Privacy** - Check if the platform offers privacy-respecting payment options
3. **Product Range** - Consider if the platform offers the products you need
4. **Local Businesses** - Some platforms focus on connecting consumers with local retailers
5. **Sustainability** - Many European alternatives emphasize environmental responsibility
6. **Data Storage** - Ensure your purchasing data is stored in the EU
