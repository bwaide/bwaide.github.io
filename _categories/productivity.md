Productivity suites have become essential for work and personal document creation, but US-based services like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Apple iWork store your documents, potentially containing sensitive information, on US servers subject to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives and open-source options offer similar productivity tools with better privacy practices and data storage within EU jurisdiction.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Productivity Suites

1. **Data Storage** - Consider where your documents are stored
2. **Collaboration** - Check if the suite offers real-time collaboration features
3. **Format Compatibility** - Ensure compatibility with common file formats
4. **Self-Hosting** - Some solutions can be self-hosted for maximum privacy
5. **Mobile Apps** - Consider if the suite offers mobile apps for your devices
6. **Integration** - Check if the suite integrates with other tools you use

Browse the alternatives below to find productivity suites that respect your privacy while helping you create and collaborate on documents.
