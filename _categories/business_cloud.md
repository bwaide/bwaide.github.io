Cloud infrastructure has become the backbone of modern business IT, but US-based providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform store your business data, applications, and potentially sensitive information on infrastructure subject to US surveillance laws.

European cloud providers offer similar services with better privacy practices and data storage within EU jurisdiction under GDPR protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Business Cloud Providers

1. **Data Sovereignty** - Ensure your data is stored exclusively in EU data centers
2. **Service Range** - Check if the provider offers all the services you need
3. **Compliance** - Look for providers with ISO 27001, GDPR, and other certifications
4. **Performance** - Consider the provider's infrastructure and network capabilities
5. **Support** - Check if the provider offers support in your language and time zone
6. **Migration Path** - Evaluate how easy it is to migrate from your current provider

Browse the alternatives below to find cloud providers that respect your data sovereignty while providing reliable infrastructure for your business needs.
