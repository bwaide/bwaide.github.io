Streaming services for movies and series have largely replaced traditional TV and DVDs, but US-based platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ track your viewing habits in detail and are subject to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives offer streaming capabilities with better privacy practices and data storage within EU jurisdiction under GDPR protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Streaming Services

1. **Content Library** - Consider if the platform offers content you're interested in
2. **Data Collection** - Check what viewing data the service collects about you
3. **Regional Availability** - Some European services are limited to specific countries
4. **Pricing Model** - Consider subscription costs vs. ad-supported options
5. **Original Content** - Some European services produce their own exclusive content
6. **Public Broadcasting** - European public broadcasters often offer streaming platforms
