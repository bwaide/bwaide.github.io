Messaging apps have become our primary means of day-to-day communication, but US-based services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger (both owned by Meta) expose your conversations and contacts to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives provide secure messaging with strong encryption and privacy features, keeping your communications private and your data within EU jurisdiction.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Messaging Apps

1. **End-to-End Encryption** - Ensure all messages are encrypted by default
2. **Data Residency** - Check where user data and metadata are stored
3. **Open Source** - Open source apps allow independent security verification
4. **Contact Privacy** - Consider how the app handles your contact list
5. **Required Information** - Some apps require phone numbers, others allow anonymous signup
6. **Cross-Platform** - Ensure the app is available on all your devices

Browse the alternatives below to find a messaging app that provides both security and convenience.
