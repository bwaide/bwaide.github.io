Web browsers are our primary gateway to the internet, but US-based browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari track your browsing history, searches, and online behavior in detail, sending this data to US servers subject to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives and privacy-focused browsers offer web browsing with enhanced privacy features, less tracking, and better data protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Web Browsers

1. **Tracking Prevention** - Consider how the browser blocks trackers and fingerprinting
2. **Data Collection** - Check what browsing data the browser itself collects
3. **Default Search Engine** - Privacy-focused browsers often use non-tracking search engines
4. **Extension Support** - Consider if the browser supports privacy extensions
5. **Performance** - Evaluate the browser's speed and resource usage
6. **Sync Features** - Check if the browser offers privacy-respecting sync between devices

Browse the alternatives below to find web browsers that respect your privacy while providing a smooth browsing experience.
