Search engines are our gateway to information online, but US-based services like Google, Bing, and Yahoo track your searches, build profiles on your interests, and are subject to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives offer search capabilities with enhanced privacy features, no tracking, and data storage within EU jurisdiction under GDPR protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Search Engines

1. **Data Collection** - Consider what information the search engine collects about you
2. **Tracking Policy** - Check if the search engine tracks your search history
3. **Filter Bubble** - Some alternatives avoid personalizing results to prevent echo chambers
4. **Result Quality** - Consider if the search engine provides relevant results
5. **Special Features** - Some privacy-focused search engines offer additional tools
6. **Business Model** - Search engines not funded by ads often respect privacy better
