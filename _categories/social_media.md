Social media has become an integral part of our social and professional lives, but US-based platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and TikTok collect vast amounts of personal data and are subject to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives and decentralized social networks offer ways to stay connected with less data collection and more privacy protections, keeping your social interactions within EU jurisdiction whenever possible.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Social Media Platforms

1. **Data Collection** - Consider what personal information the platform collects
2. **Algorithmic Transparency** - Check if the platform is open about how it ranks content
3. **Decentralization** - Decentralized networks distribute control of your data
4. **Monetization Model** - Platforms that don't rely on ads often respect privacy more
5. **Content Export** - Ensure you can export your data if you want to leave
6. **Community Size** - Consider if the platform has enough users to meet your needs

Browse the alternatives below to find social media platforms that respect your privacy while keeping you connected.
