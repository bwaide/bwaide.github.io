Smart home assistants provide convenience through voice control of your home, but US-based devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Siri continuously listen to your home environment and process this data on US servers, subject to US surveillance laws.

European alternatives and self-hosted options offer smart home capabilities with better privacy practices and data storage within EU jurisdiction.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Smart Home Assistants

1. **Data Storage** - Consider where your voice recordings and commands are stored
2. **Always Listening** - Check if the device continuously listens or uses wake words
3. **Local Processing** - Some alternatives process commands locally without cloud dependency
4. **Self-Hosting** - Consider solutions you can host yourself for maximum privacy
5. **Device Compatibility** - Ensure compatibility with your existing smart home devices
6. **Offline Functionality** - Some privacy-focused options work without internet connection

Browse the alternatives below to find smart home solutions that respect your privacy while making your home smarter.
