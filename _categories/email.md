Email remains one of the most critical business and personal communication tools, but US-based email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo Mail expose your communications to US surveillance laws like FISA 702, Executive Order 12333, and the CLOUD Act.

European alternatives provide comparable functionality while offering enhanced privacy protections and keeping your data within EU jurisdiction and under GDPR protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Email Services

1. **Data Residency** - Ensure your emails are stored exclusively in EU data centers
2. **End-to-End Encryption** - Look for services with built-in encryption options
3. **Custom Domains** - For businesses, check if you can use your own domain name
4. **Migration Tools** - Consider how easy it is to migrate from your current provider
5. **Calendar & Contacts** - Most users need integrated calendar and contact management
6. **Mobile Apps** - Check compatibility with your mobile devices

Browse the alternatives below to find an email service that meets your privacy and communication needs.
