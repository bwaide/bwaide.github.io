Email remains one of the most critical business communication tools, but US-based email providers like Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Outlook may expose your communications to US surveillance laws.

European email alternatives provide similar functionality while offering enhanced privacy protections and keeping your data within EU jurisdiction.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Email Services

1. **Data Residency** - Ensure your emails are stored exclusively in EU data centers
2. **End-to-End Encryption** - Look for services with built-in encryption options
3. **Custom Domains** - For businesses, check if you can use your own domain name
4. **Migration Tools** - Consider how easy it is to migrate from your current provider
5. **Calendar & Contacts** - Most businesses need integrated calendar and contact management
6. **Mobile Apps** - Check compatibility with your mobile devices

Browse the alternatives below to find an email service that meets your privacy and business communication needs.
