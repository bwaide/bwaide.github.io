Cloud storage services allow you to store files online, sync them across devices, and share them with others. US-based services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive may expose your data to US surveillance laws such as FISA 702, Executive Order 12333, and the CLOUD Act.

European alternatives offer similar functionality while keeping your data within EU jurisdiction and under GDPR protection.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Cloud Storage

1. **Data Residency** - Ensure your data is stored exclusively in EU data centers
2. **End-to-End Encryption** - Look for services with zero-knowledge encryption
3. **Collaborative Features** - Assess if the service meets your sharing and collaboration needs
4. **Desktop/Mobile Apps** - Check compatibility with your devices and operating systems
5. **Business Features** - For organizations, consider admin controls, user management, and audit logs
