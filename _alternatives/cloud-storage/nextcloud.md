Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted file sync and share solution that gives you complete control over your data. It's one of the most popular alternatives to services like Dropbox and Google Drive, offering a comprehensive suite of features while ensuring your data remains under your control.

## Why Choose Nextcloud

Nextcloud offers significant privacy advantages as you can either self-host it on your own servers or choose an EU-based managed hosting provider. This ensures your data never leaves EU jurisdiction and isn't subject to US surveillance laws.

The platform is highly extensible with hundreds of apps that add functionality like document editing, calendar, contacts, tasks, and even video conferencing. This makes it a comprehensive alternative to multiple Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 services.

## Data Residency and Privacy

Nextcloud can be hosted entirely within the EU, either on your own infrastructure or with European hosting providers. The self-hosted nature means you have complete control over where your data is stored. When using a managed hosting provider, you can select one that guarantees EU-only data storage.

## Security Features

- Two-factor authentication
- Brute force protection
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Fine-grained access control

## Limitations

- Self-hosting requires technical expertise for setup and maintenance
