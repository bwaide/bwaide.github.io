Kaufland.de is the online marketplace of the Schwarz Group, one of Europe's largest retail groups, also known for Lidl supermarkets. The platform offers a wide range of products from groceries to electronics, household items, and more, serving as a European alternative to Amazon.

## Why Choose Kaufland.de

Kaufland.de stands out as a European-owned and operated general merchandise marketplace that keeps all customer data within EU jurisdiction. Originally launched as real.de, then acquired and rebranded by the Schwarz Group, the platform combines the convenience of online shopping with the reliability of an established European retail company.

The platform offers both Kaufland's own products and items from third-party sellers, creating a diverse marketplace. Its integration with physical Kaufland stores for pickup and returns adds convenience for many European consumers.
