Element is a secure messaging app built on the open Matrix protocol, offering end-to-end encrypted communication with extensive privacy features. It provides a decentralized alternative to services like WhatsApp, allowing users to choose where their data is stored or even host their own server.

## Why Choose Element

Element stands out for its decentralized architecture through the Matrix protocol. Unlike centralized messaging apps where a single company controls all user data, Matrix is a network of servers that can communicate with each other (similar to email), allowing users to choose their server or host their own while still communicating with users on other servers.

This approach gives users unprecedented control over their data privacy. Element offers end-to-end encryption by default for direct messages and the option to enable it for group chats. The app is feature-rich, supporting messaging, voice and video calls, file sharing, and collaboration tools.

## Data Residency and Privacy

- Decentralized architecture through Matrix protocol
- EU-hosted options available through Element Matrix Services
- Self-hosting option for complete data sovereignty
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE) for messages
- No phone number required (can register with email)
- Open-source code allows security auditing
- Minimal metadata collection

## Features

- Cross-platform applications (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, web)
- One-to-one and group messaging
- Voice and video calls
- Spaces (communities for organizing rooms)
- File sharing and collaboration
- Rich text formatting and reactions
- Bridges to other platforms (Slack, Discord, IRC, etc.)
- Message editing and deletion
- Custom themes and appearance settings
- Read receipts and typing indicators
- Third-party integrations and bots

## Self-Hosting Options

- Self-host a Matrix homeserver (Synapse or Dendrite)
- Full control over user data and server policies
- Connect to the wider Matrix federation
- Option to run a private, non-federated server
- Docker containers available for easy deployment

## Limitations

- More technical complexity than centralized messaging apps
- E2EE not enabled by default for all rooms (must be enabled for group chats)
- Smaller user base than WhatsApp or Signal
- Federation can sometimes cause delays in message delivery
- Cross-signing key verification more complex than some alternatives
- Requires some technical knowledge to self-host
