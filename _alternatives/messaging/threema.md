Threema is a privacy-focused messaging app based in Switzerland that offers end-to-end encryption for all communications. Unlike many messaging apps, Threema allows completely anonymous use without requiring a phone number or email address for registration.

## Why Choose Threema

Threema stands out for its exceptional privacy-by-design approach and Swiss jurisdiction. The app is developed by Threema GmbH, based in Switzerland, which benefits from the country's strong privacy laws outside of EU and US jurisdictions. Threema's business model is based on a one-time purchase rather than data collection or advertising.

A key differentiator is Threema's anonymous sign-up process. Users receive a random Threema ID upon installation and can use the app without providing any personal information. Messages, group memberships, and contact lists are stored locally on the user's device, not on Threema's servers.
