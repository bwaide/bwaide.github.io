Signal is a secure messaging app that prioritizes privacy with strong encryption and minimal data collection. While technically US-based, Signal's design ensures that even this jurisdiction has minimal privacy implications.

## Why Choose Signal

Signal is widely regarded as one of the most secure messaging platforms available. All messages, calls, and media are end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning only the communicating users can read them. The app is designed to collect as little metadata as possible.

Signal is developed by the Signal Foundation, a nonprofit organization committed to open source privacy technology. Its protocol is so respected that it's been adopted by many other messaging services.

## Data Residency and Privacy

While Signal's parent organization is based in the US, its architecture ensures that almost no meaningful data is stored on its servers:

- Messages and calls are never stored on Signal's servers
- The only data stored is your phone number, when you registered, and when you last connected
- Signal implements innovative techniques to encrypt even the metadata of your communications
- No data is sold to advertisers or third parties

## Security Features

- State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (Signal Protocol)
- Disappearing messages with customizable timeframes
- Screen security features to prevent screenshots
- Safety numbers to verify contact identity
- Local data encryption
- Call relay options to hide IP addresses

## Limitations

- Requires a phone number to register
- Smaller user base than WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger
- More privacy-oriented than feature-rich compared to some mainstream alternatives
