Mozilla Firefox is a privacy-focused web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation, a nonprofit organization. While it's technically US-based, Firefox is designed with privacy as a core principle, making it a better alternative to browsers like Chrome, Edge, or Safari.

## Why Choose Firefox

Firefox stands out for its commitment to privacy as one of its core values. Unlike browsers from Google, Microsoft, or Apple, Firefox is not developed by a company that profits from tracking user behavior. Mozilla's business model is not dependent on collecting and monetizing user data.

Firefox includes robust tracking protection features by default and has been a pioneer in implementing privacy enhancements that other browsers later adopted. It also supports a wide range of privacy-enhancing extensions.

## Data Residency and Privacy

While Mozilla is based in the US, Firefox is designed to minimize data collection:

- Most browsing data stays on your device by default
- Tracking protection blocks known trackers
- Mozilla collects limited telemetry data, which can be disabled
- No integration with advertising ecosystems
- Firefox Sync data is end-to-end encrypted

## Privacy Features

- Enhanced Tracking Protection blocks trackers by default
- Firefox Containers isolate websites from each other
- Private Browsing mode with tracking protection
- HTTPS-Only mode for secure connections
- Fingerprinting protection
- DNS over HTTPS for encrypted DNS queries
- Support for privacy extensions like uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger

## Limitations

- US-based organization (though nonprofit)
- Some features like Pocket integration have raised privacy concerns
- Default search engine in many regions is Google (though easily changed)
- Performance can be less optimized than Chromium-based browsers on some sites
