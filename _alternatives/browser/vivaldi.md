Vivaldi is a feature-rich, highly customizable web browser that places a strong emphasis on user privacy and control. Developed by Vivaldi Technologies, founded by former Opera CEO Jon von Tetzchner, the browser offers a European alternative to US-based browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari.

## Why Choose Vivaldi

Vivaldi stands out for its European roots and privacy-first approach. Based in Norway (part of the EU/EEA), Vivaldi Technologies is subject to robust European privacy regulations including GDPR. The company does not track users' browsing or collect data for ad targeting, and it stores all sync data in Iceland, providing strong data sovereignty within the European Economic Area.

The browser offers exceptional customization options, allowing users to tailor almost every aspect of the browsing experience to their preferences. From extensive theme controls to unique productivity features like tab stacking, web panels, and an integrated notes system, Vivaldi is designed for users who want both privacy and powerful features.
