Tutanota is a secure email service based in Germany that offers end-to-end encryption for all emails. Its name derives from Latin, meaning "secure message." It focuses on providing maximum security with a simple user interface.

## Why Choose Tutanota

Tutanota stands out for its strong privacy focus and German jurisdiction. All data is stored on servers located in Germany, which has some of the strongest data protection laws in the EU. The company's business model is based on paid subscriptions rather than advertising, ensuring they have no incentive to scan or analyze your emails.

The service features automatic end-to-end encryption for all emails between Tutanota users, and allows sending encrypted emails to non-Tutanota users through a password-protected access.

## Data Residency and Privacy

- All servers are located in Germany
- No data centers outside the EU
- Subject to strict German and EU data protection laws
- Completely independent from US companies or investors
- Zero-knowledge encryption (even Tutanota can't read your emails)

## Security Features

- Automatic end-to-end encryption
- Encrypted address book and calendar
- Two-factor authentication
- Open source code for transparency
- IP address anonymization
- No tracking or analytics

## Limitations

- Free plan limited to 1GB storage and one email address
- Search functionality is more limited than Gmail due to encryption
- No IMAP/POP support (by design, for security reasons)
