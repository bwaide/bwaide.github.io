ProtonMail is a secure email service based in Switzerland that offers end-to-end encryption. Founded by scientists from CERN, it has established itself as one of the leading privacy-focused email providers globally.

## Why Choose ProtonMail

ProtonMail stands out for its strong privacy focus and Swiss jurisdiction. Switzerland has some of the strongest privacy laws in the world, outside of both US and EU jurisdiction but compliant with GDPR. All data is stored on servers located in Switzerland, which offers strong legal protection for email privacy.

The service features automatic end-to-end encryption for all emails between ProtonMail users, and allows sending encrypted emails to non-ProtonMail users through a password-protected access link.

## Data Residency and Privacy

- All servers are located in Switzerland
- No data centers outside Switzerland
- Subject to strict Swiss privacy laws
- Completely independent from US companies or investors
- Zero-access encryption prevents even ProtonMail from reading your emails
