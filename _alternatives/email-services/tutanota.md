Tutanota is a secure email service based in Germany that offers end-to-end encryption for all emails between Tutanota users. It's designed with privacy at its core and serves as an excellent alternative to services like Gmail.

## Why Choose Tutanota

Tutanota stands out for its strong privacy focus and German jurisdiction. All data is stored on servers located in Germany, which has some of the strongest data protection laws in the EU. The company's business model is based on paid subscriptions rather than advertising, ensuring they have no incentive to scan or analyze your emails.

The service features automatic end-to-end encryption for all emails between Tutanota users, and even allows sending encrypted emails to non-Tutanota users through a password-protected access link.

## Data Residency and Privacy

- All servers are located in Germany
- No data centers outside the EU
- Subject to strict German and EU data protection laws
- Completely independent from US companies or investors

## Security Features

- Automatic end-to-end encryption
- Encrypted address book and calendar
- Two-factor authentication
- Open source client code for transparency
- Zero-access encryption (even Tutanota can't read your emails)
- IP anonymization

## Limitations

- Interface is simpler than some competitors
- Limited third-party integrations due to security focus
- Free plan has some restrictions on features and storage
