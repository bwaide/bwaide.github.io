Qwant is a privacy-focused search engine based in France that doesn't track users or personalize search results based on user profiles. It offers a European alternative to US-based search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

## Why Choose Qwant

Qwant stands out for its strict privacy policy and European jurisdiction. Unlike Google or Bing, Qwant doesn't collect your search history or build profiles about you to serve targeted ads. Your searches are private and not used to influence future results.

The search engine is based in France and subject to EU data protection laws, giving users stronger privacy protections than US-based services. Qwant was also the first search engine to be certified by the French National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) for its privacy practices.
