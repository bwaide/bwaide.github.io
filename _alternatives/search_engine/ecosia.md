Ecosia is an eco-friendly search engine based in Berlin, Germany that uses its profits to plant trees around the world. It offers a sustainable alternative to US-based search engines while maintaining strong privacy protections.

## Why Choose Ecosia

Ecosia stands out for its environmental mission and transparent business model. For every 45 searches you make, Ecosia plants approximately one tree in areas suffering from deforestation. The company publishes monthly financial reports showing exactly how much money was earned and how many trees were planted.

Beyond its environmental focus, Ecosia respects user privacy. It doesn't store searches permanently, doesn't use third-party trackers, anonymizes all searches within one week, and doesn't sell data to advertisers or create personal profiles.

## Data Residency and Privacy

- Limited data collection for service improvements
- Anonymizes all searches within one week
