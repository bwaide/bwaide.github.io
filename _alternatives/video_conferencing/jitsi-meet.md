Jitsi Meet is a fully free, open-source video conferencing solution that doesn't require accounts or software installation. It can be self-hosted by organizations on their own infrastructure, making it a flexible alternative to proprietary services like Zoom or Microsoft Teams.

## Why Choose Jitsi Meet

Jitsi Meet stands out for its commitment to privacy, security, and open-source principles. Since it's completely open-source, organizations can host their own instances on servers within the EU, ensuring complete data sovereignty. This makes it particularly appealing for privacy-conscious users and organizations.

The service works directly in web browsers without requiring any downloads (though apps are available), has no meeting time limits, and doesn't require participants to create accounts. All these factors make it exceptionally accessible and user-friendly.
