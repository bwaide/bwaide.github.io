WOW (formerly Sky Ticket) is a streaming-only service from Sky Deutschland that offers access to Sky's premium content without long-term contracts or satellite hardware. It provides a flexible, internet-based alternative to traditional Sky subscriptions with monthly packages for films, series, and sports.

## Why Choose WOW

WOW stands out as a flexible, no-commitment way to access Sky's premium content, operating under German and EU regulations to ensure all user data remains within EU jurisdiction. The service was rebranded from Sky Ticket to WOW in 2022, focusing on providing a more streamlined experience.

It offers much of Sky's premium content (including HBO shows, Bundesliga football, and exclusive movies) without requiring satellite dishes or hardware rental.
