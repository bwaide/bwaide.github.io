BlueSky is a decentralized social network built on the AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol), initiated by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey but now developed as an independent project. It offers a Twitter-like experience with greater user control and the potential for multiple competing service providers.

## Why Choose BlueSky

BlueSky stands out for its innovative approach to decentralization through the AT Protocol, which separates the social network's underlying protocol from the applications and services built on top of it. This allows users to switch between providers without losing their identity, followers, or content.

The platform gives users more control over their experience with features like customizable feeds, algorithm transparency, and the ability to moderate their own experience. While still in development, BlueSky aims to create a more open, user-controlled social media landscape.
