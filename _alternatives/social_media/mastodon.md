Mastodon is a decentralized, open-source social network that functions similarly to Twitter but without the centralized control, algorithmic manipulation, or data harvesting. Instead of one company running the entire network, Mastodon consists of thousands of independent servers (instances) that communicate with each other.

## Why Choose Mastodon

Mastodon stands out for its decentralized structure, which means no single entity controls the entire network. Each Mastodon server (known as an "instance") can set its own rules and moderation policies, allowing users to choose communities that align with their values.

Unlike Twitter, Facebook, or other US-based platforms, Mastodon doesn't track users to sell targeted advertising, doesn't manipulate your timeline with engagement-optimizing algorithms, and gives users far more control over their social media experience.

## Data Residency and Privacy

- Decentralized architecture means no central data repository
- Many EU-based instances with strong privacy policies
- Each instance only stores data for its own users
- No tracking or targeted advertising
- No data mining or selling of user information
- Control over who sees your posts (public, followers-only, etc.)

## Features

- Microblogging with 500 character posts
- Chronological timelines without algorithmic interference
- Media sharing (images, videos, audio)
- Content warnings for sensitive topics
- Robust blocking and filtering tools
- Cross-instance following (follow users on other servers)
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android

## Limitations

- Smaller user base than mainstream platforms
- Learning curve for new users (server selection, federated nature)
- Features can vary between instances
- Finding specific users can be harder without a central directory
- Some public figures and brands haven't migrated yet
